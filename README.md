# OGE
Open Guerrilla Editor. An open source modding tool for Red Faction Guerrilla. Still in it's very early stages. The current goal is to make a comprehensive modding tool for RFG that automates some things that people used to do by hand such as updating asm_pc files, and eliminates the need for multiple command line tools. As it's expanded some existing tools like the [new texture editor](https://github.com/Moneyl/RFG-Texture-Editor-Redux) will likely be merged with this tool since there are some convenience features that can be provided by having both tools in one program.
